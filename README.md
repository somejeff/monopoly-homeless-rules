# Monopoly "Homeless" Rules

> *Sure! I've got 6 hours to kill* -- Said no one

House rules in Monopoly tend to drag the unbearable game on for hours. Free parking leads to free cash.

This collaborative variant aims to apply brutal reality to Monopoly by switching up the rules of the game.

## Target State

1. Keep the game short, so you're in and out before boredom sets in.
2. Use real life as an example to teach people the hard lessons.
